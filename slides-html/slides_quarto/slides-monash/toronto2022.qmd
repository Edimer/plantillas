First, <span class="fragment highlight-red" fragment-index=3>48 cotton sheets are randomly allocated to the washing machines, six per machine.</span> The <span class="fragment highlight-blue" fragment-index=4>wash temperatures are randomly allocated to the washing machines so that two machines are run at each temperature.</span> After the wash, the <span class="fragment highlight-red" fragment-index=5>six sheets in each machine are randomly allocated to the dryers, one per dryer.</span> Then the <span class="fragment highlight-blue" fragment-index=6>drying temperatures are randomly allocated to the dryers</span> so that two machines are run at each temperature. After the drying, all <span class="fragment highlight-red" fragment-index=7>48 sheets are scored by experts for how wrinkled they are</span>.

## `edibble` records 

* Records are intended variables, e.g. responses, that will be measured or observed

. . . 

* You can **set expectations** of the record (plausible values) and **simulate records**, censoring values (default as missing) outside of expectations, or **export data with data validation**

## [STORY 3]{.story} üç™ The legend of the scrumptious cookie {auto-animate=true auto-animate-easing="ease-in-out"}




::: box

Recipes  for  chocolate  and  orange  cookies  include  exactly the same ingredients up to the point where the syrup was added to the batch. However, after the cookies were baked, the chocolate cookies had an appealing round  and  plump  appearance,  while  the  orange  cookies  spread  during  the baking process and became thin, flat, and unappealing. A factorial experiment was devised to determine if there was a way to change the process of making the orange cookies that would reduce the spreading during baking. The factors that were chosen to be varied were A: the amount of shortening in the dough batch (80% of what the recipe called for or 100%), B: the baking temperature (below,  at,  or  above  the  temperature  called  for  by  the  recipe),  and C:  the temperature  of  the  cookie  sheet  upon  which  the  cookies  were  placed  to  be baked (hot out of the oven, or cooled to room temperature). The cookie-making process consists of the two steps: 1. mix cookie dough batch, and 2. bake cookies. Factor A is related to step 1, factors B and C to step 2. The amount of shortening was a hard-to-vary factor because each time it was changed it required making a new batch of cookie dough, while the baking temperature and tray temperature were easy to vary. Once  a  batch  of  dough  was  made,  there  was  enough  to  make  six  trays  of cookies, and all six combinations of baking temperature and tray temperature could be tested within each dough batch. First, plan to make four batches of cookie dough and randomly assign two batches to use 80% of the recipe recommended amount of shortening and two batches to receive the full amount of shortening recommended by the recipe. Next, bake six trays of cookies from each batch of dough and completely randomize the six combinations of bake temperature and tray temperature to the six trays of cookies within each batch.
